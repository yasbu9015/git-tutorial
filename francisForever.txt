i dont know what to do without you
i dont know where to put my hands
ive been trying to lay my head down
but im writing this at 3 am

i dont need the world to see 
that ive been the best i can be but
i dont think i could stand to be 
where you dont see me

on sunny days i go out walking
i end up on a tree lined street
i look up at the gaps on sunlight
i miss you more than anything

i dont need the world to see
that ive been the best i can be but
i dont think i could stand to be
where you dont see me

and autumn comes when youre not yet done
with the summer passing by but
i dont think i could stand to be
where you dont see me

- francis forever, mitski
